Monkeys In Space: <br />                Environmental Structure, Ecology and Cognition</strong></h3>            <p style="width: 705px;">As long-lived, slowly reproducing animals,              primates face numerous ecological challenges to survival and              successful reproduction. As group-living animals, the social world              presents an equally diverse array of challenges that require the              negotiation of individual needs within the constraints imposed by              others. Most research aimed at defining and identifying the nature              of primate social cognition has focused on the specific demands of              the social world, and pays less attention to how environmental and              ecological demands interact with these. Our approach stresses that              an animal's actions are structured, supported and constrained by              its immediate local circumstances. It generates the broad              proposition underpinning our long-term research program - that              primate cognition is geared to enabling advantageous responses to              current contingencies. That is, they have been selected to              exploit, as well as respond to, the unpredictable opportunities              offered by both the physical (ecological) and social environments.              Our long-term intent has been to bring these two perspectives              together by considering how primates solve ecological problems in              a social context. Most of our empirical work targets social              dynamics and group coordination processes as instances of              phenotypically plastic behaviours that have the potential to              reveal both the scope and limits of flexible responses to              environmental challenge.</p>            <p style="width: 705px;"><strong>Current Funding: NSERC Discovery                grants (LB, SPH), NSERC Canada Research Chairs Program (LB), NRF                Incentive Fund (SPH).<br />                <br />              </strong></p>            <div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="images/group.png" /><br />            </div>            <br />            <h4 style="width: 705px; margin-top: 23.6167px;"><strong>The Thermal                Competence Of Social Endotherms<br />              </strong></h4>            <p style="width: 705px;">In addition to these general topic areas,              reflected in the projects of various lab members, we began, in              2010, a large collaborative project (Lethbridge, Witwatersrand,              UNISA, Western Australia, Wisconsin-Madison) directed at              identifying the consequences of obligatory sociality for thermal              performance under changing climates. To do so, we have body              temperature records at five-minute intervals from known vervet              monkeys in parallel with data on activity, social behaviour,              physiological stress, spatial location and microclimate. This              allows us to chart, not only individual responses to local              conditions in both the short and long term, but also the ways in              which group use of space reflects a compromise among a range of              competing pressures, with differing outcomes for particular              individuals. Active data collection ended in 2018 leaving a              cumulative sample of approximately 140 monkey-years of temperature              data, by far the largest data set of its kind from any endotherm,              over a period that has encompassed a complete drought cycle. </p>            <p style="width: 705px;"><strong>Funding: NSERC Discovery grant                (SPH), NSERC CRC Program (LB), NRF Large Competitive Grant                Program awards (SPH, Duncan Mitchell), Ernest Oppenheimer Fund                (Duncan Mitchell), Carnegie Large Research Grant (Andrea                Fuller), Claude Leon Fellowship award and Wisconsin-Madison                internal funds (Richard McFarland)</strong>.<br />              <strong></strong></p>            <span class="smaller"></span>            <p> </p>            <br />            <div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="images/thermal%20vervets.jpg" /><br />              <br />            </div>            <img src="images/ground%20squirrel.png" alt="" />            <h3 style="width: 705px;"><strong><br />                B.

In evolutionary                terms, life history is the combination of the probabilities of                survival and fecundity that a species displays in its natural                environment, and is closely tied to the study of demography. In                our work, we apply life history theory to baboons and vervet                monkeys, assessing how females trade-off risks of intrinsic and                extrinsic mortality against levels of investment in offspring.                We also study reproductive decision-making in life history                perspective in contemporary human societies, looking at both                industrialised and developing nations.

The first -<em>                  Loskop Dam Nature Reserve</em> - is in Mpumalanga Province,                South Africa - and consists primarily of <em>Acacia-Combretum</em>                woodland. The second but primary site - <em>Samara Game Reserve</em>                - is in the Eastern Cape Province and, as befits the karoo, is                known, increasingly, for extremes of climate. Vervets have                penetrated this semi-desert region along riverine <em>Acacia </em>                corridors and, in contrast to the Loskop population, the reduced                possibility of successful fission has resulted in a population                characterised by very large groups living at high density.                Project video (courtesy of Chloé Vilette): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPWnw6M0TKg"                  target="_blank"></a><a                  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPWnw6M0TKg"                  target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPWnw6M0TKg</a><br />              </span></p>            <img title="Samara Game Reserve" src="images/samara.png" />            <p align="left"> </p>            <p align="left" style="width: 705px; height: 124px;"><strong>BABOONS</strong><br />              Our initial<strong> </strong>baboon field work took place at the              <em>De Hoop Nature Reserve</em>, in the Western Cape Province of              South Africa (1996-2007). De Hoop lies along the coast in a winter              rainfall belt and was proclaimed to protect its endemic fynbos              plant communities. Its baboons are members of the species'              southern-most population and our initial interest in them stemmed              from their unusual ecology. We no longer work at De Hoop but are              busy with analyses of the long-term demographic and social              databases, as well as with the detailed spatial data set amassed              by Dr Parry Clarke. More recently, however, we have habituated two              baboon groups at <em>Samara</em>, folding them into the              thermoregulation research program. Doing so allows us to compare              the performance of two very differently sized social primates              under the same climatic conditions.</p>            <br />            <br />            <p style="text-align: center;"><img title="De Hoop" alt="" src="images/de%20hoop.png" /><span                class="style8"></span></p>            <p style="width: 705px;"><span class="style8"></span><br />              Chacma baboons, particularly, are able to occupy a broad range of              habitat types - often extreme - and our longer-term              cross-population objective has been to understand how they manage              to do so and with what social sequelae.
